# SimpleSmartContract
Use of Solidity and Web3 to make a simple ethereum smart contract

A smart contract is a program that comprises of data and functions that run when a transaction is received. This simple application serves as a platform for anyone with access to the internet to send a message that will be logged on the blockchain via an Ethereum smart contract. The Rinkeby test net was used to create and implement the Smart contract. Anyone with a MetaMask account can connect their wallets and engage with the Smart contract over the website with the help of Web3. The input that users who interact with the website provide is saved in the smart contract, connected to a local Ethereum
network. When a user sends a message, they have the opportunity to win a small amount of ETH from the application.
